The tutorials, Jekyll themes, and other articles I publish have been a true labor of love for me, If you've found any of this content useful here's how to show your thanks and motivate me to do more.

## Get Social
There are ways to help if you’d prefer a free option. You can follow me on Twitter. It’s free and does make a difference! My other social media accounts are linked from the homepage. Alternatively, share an article with a friend, or drop me a line and let me know what you thought. i'd prefer this method, it's free and awesome for me.
