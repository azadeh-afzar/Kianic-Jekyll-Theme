Hello. I'm Mahdi and I'm developer of this theme! feel free to get in touch with me about this jekyll theme.

## Website
For a long time, I was proponent of [**<i class="fab fa-wordpress-simple" aria-hidden="true"></i> Wordpress**](https://wordpress.org "Wordpress"){:target="_blank"} as blogging platform, but have more recently I've started to prefer static website generators. I'm currently using [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll's website"){:target="_blank"} framework for development, I decided to use Jekyll because of it's integration with [**Github Pages <i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>**](https://pages.github.com "Github Pages"){:target="_blank"}. In exchange for a little convenience and functionality, a static website is faster and more secure and I also have more control over my own website.
Visit my website to find more about me: `MahdiBaghbani.ir`.
